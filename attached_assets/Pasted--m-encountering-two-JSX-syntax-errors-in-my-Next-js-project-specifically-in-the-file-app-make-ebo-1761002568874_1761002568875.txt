'm encountering two JSX syntax errors in my Next.js project, specifically in the file ./app/make-ebook/page.tsx. The error messages are:

Caused by: Syntax Error

These errors suggest issues in the MakeEbookPage component, likely due to:





Mismatched or excessive closing JSX tags (e.g., </div></main></div></div></div> on line 1769).



A misplaced closing parenthesis ) or function brace } causing the parser to expect a closing tag but encounter a return statement in the MakeEbookPageWrapper component.

Please help me fix these errors by:





Analyzing the provided code snippet to identify the syntax issues in the MakeEbookPage component, particularly around lines 1768–1771, where multiple closing tags and a closing brace are causing the errors.



Correcting the JSX structure to ensure all tags (<div>, <main>, etc.) are properly nested and closed, and the return statement’s parentheses wrap the entire JSX structure.



Ensuring the MakeEbookPage component’s function body is properly closed with a } after the return statement.



Verifying that the MakeEbookPageWrapper component (starting at line 1773) is unaffected by the fixes and remains correctly structured.



Providing a corrected version of the page.tsx file, including both the MakeEbookPage and MakeEbookPageWrapper components, formatted to adhere to Next.js and TypeScript conventions.



If the snippet is insufficient to pinpoint the exact issue, suggest what additional code (e.g., the full MakeEbookPage component) is needed for a precise fix.



Making reasonable assumptions about undefined elements (e.g., SomeComponent or markDirty) and explaining them in comments within the code.

Ensure the solution is compatible with Next.js 15.5.2 and TypeScript, and that it resolves both the "Unexpected token" and "Expected '</', got 'return'" errors.
